# minimal-pov-clock
A POV Clock with a focus on a minimal design and light weight quiet running.  It should be capable of running 24/7.

My intention is to display a digital clock, not analogue.  The time will orbit around the motor so that it is visible 360 degrees - you can quickly see what time it is regardless of where you are in a room.

This is repository is a place for me to collate my thoughts on this design.

My original inspiration comes from
http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Wireless-Power-POV-Display/

There is a video of that project here:

The creator then made this truly beautiful minimalistic POV display:

But he pointed at the original instructable as a guide to build that display.  I've asked for some information, specifically on how the LED has been connected.  Hope I get a response.

The original project uses a CD motor, but I'm exploring the concept of using a really simple motor to keep things simple
